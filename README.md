If you found this, welcome! These are my personal notes, assembled in an [obsidian workspace](https://obsidian.md/). You should be able to view them just fine here on github, but obsidian defines a few extensions to the markdown language, so for best viewing experience the native obsidian client is recommended.

If you found something hard to understand or even plain wrong, I'd appreciate if you'd let me know via an issue. Improving the notes helps future viewers out a lot - and one of those future viewers is going to be myself!
